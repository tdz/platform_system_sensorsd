# sensorsd

Sensorsd wraps Android's Sensors driver behind a network protocol. The
program is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See the file LICENSE
for more information.

Sensorsd acts as a proxy between Android's Sensors driver and an external
program. It opens the Sensors driver and waits on a socket connection for
external commands (i.e., from Gecko). When a command arrives it executes
a corresponding driver operation and reports back the result. If the
Sensors driver signals an event (i.e., a sensor fired), sensorsd forwards
a corresponding notification to the connected program.


## Supported Versions

Sensorsd supports Android with API version 14 or later.


## Building

Sensorsd should come as part of your b2g repository. Otherwise, you can
clone the repository into your local b2g checkout and add the target

  sensorsd

to the list of packages. See the file NOTICE for a pointer to the latest
code release. Sensorsd requires

  libfdio
  libpdu

Both libraries are available from the same location as sensorsd.


## Protocol

For IPC, sensorsd uses a protocol as defined in doc/ipc.txt. The protocol
is supposed to be stable across releases.


## Coding style

Sensorsd is implemented in C. The dialect is C89 with GNU extensions. The
coding style follows the guidelines for C++ as defined at

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style

with the following exceptions:

  * use lower case with underscores (foo_bar) instead of camel case (FooBar)

  * no 'moz_' prefixes are required (or similar namespace separation)

  * except for 'g_' for global variables

  * in the general case return 0 for success and -1 for errors

  * print an error message *exactly* where the error occurs

  * use '#pragma once' instead of include guards
