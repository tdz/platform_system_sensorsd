/*
 * Command-line options
 *
 * The functions below parse the command-line options into an options
 * structure. The entry point for this functionality is |parse_opts|,
 * which takes the options count and array as input, and an options
 * structure for returning the parsed values.
 *
 * For each supported option, there's a |parse_opt_*| function. None
 * of these function should be called from outside of |parse_opts|. We
 * currently only support 'a' for settings the daemons network address
 * and 'h' for printing general information about the program.
 *
 * The return value of the parser functions differ slightly from the
 * usual conventions. A value of '0' means success and a value of '-1'
 * means 'abort with error'; like in other functions. But there's also
 * '1', which mean 'exit with success'. Returning '1' from the parser
 * function will terminate the program reporting success. That's helpful
 * for options that don't want sensorsd to enter its main loop, such as
 * 'h'.

/*
 * Initialization and program start up
 *
 * After starting the program, the Android kernel gives us a few
 * milliseconds until it suspends the system. So the first thing
 * Sensorsd's |main| function does is to acquire a wake lock to
 * ensure progress during the initialization.
 *
 * Next it starts parsing the command-line arguments by calling
 * |parse_opts|. If command-line arguments are OK, sensorsd is ready
 * to turn it self into a system service.
 *
 * The first step towards becoming a system service is a call to
 * |make_daemon|, which uncouples sensorsd from its environment as
 * far as that's possible. The function contains comments for each
 * performed step.
 *
 * Next sensorsd starts its main loop and opens a socket connection
 * to the client program. |epoll_loop| is part of libfdio and handles
 * all I/O and events. We never leave it during normal operation.
 *
 * Initialization is performed by |init|. If first sets up the task
 * queue, which also comes with libfdio, and then opens the socket
 * to the client with a call to |init_io|. We need to do all these
 * operations in the callback, because they require the I/O loop to
 * be running. libfdio contains mor information about |epoll_loop|
 * and how to use it.
 *
 * After |init_io| returned successfully, we should have a pending
 * connection to the client program. It's now safe to drop the wake
 * lock. Any further operation will be triggered by the client and
 * sensorsd will wake up when commands or data are available.
 *
 * When we leave the main I/O loop during program termination, the
 * callback to |uninit| will clean up the resources. It won't run
 * if |init| failed, so anything we set up in |init| can be expected
 * to be initialized.
 *
 * Both |init| and |uninit| receive a pointer to arbitrary data. In
 * the case of sensorsd, its the options structure with the program's
 * configuration.
 *
 * Finally some words about multithreading:
 *
 * All functions are expected to run on the thread that contains the
 * main I/O loop and none of the data structures are thread-safe by
 * default. All IPC and I/O should be executed within the I/O loop
 * *without* blocking the loop! See the header files of libfdio for
 * the related documentation.
 *
 * Exceptions to the I/O-thread-only rule are allowed for individual
 * services. Some services might need to block when polling device
 * drivers, or as part of the drivers interface. Blocking operation
 * should be performed on a separate thread. Don't call the I/O loop
 * from this thread. Instead call |run_task| with the function and
 * data to execute. |run_task| sends the task to the I/O thread where
 * it is executed within the I/O loop.
