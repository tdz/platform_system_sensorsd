/*
 * This file contains the public interface to the Registry service.
 *
 * Two functions are provided: |init_registry| and |uninit_registry| for
 * registering and unregistering the service in the protocol framework.
 *
 * For registering, |init_registry| takes a callback for sending PDUs
 * and returns '0' on success. On errors, '-1' is retured. It sets up
 * the registry's internal state to process further commands. Once the
 * function returns succesfully, the Registry service will be able to
 * process commands. The init funtion's only parameter is a pointer to
 * the PDU send function of the I/O framework. The service will send out
 * its PDUs using this function and forward the address to any service
 * that is registered by the client.
 *
 * The function for unregistering, |unregister_poll|, frees the service's
 * resources. Once it returns no commands can be processed.
 *
 * The public interface of the Registry service is different from other
 * services as it does not return a function pointer when registering.
 * This is because Registry is supposed to be initialized during start
 * up and not by a command from the client. Clients can expect this
 * service to be available all the time.
